This repository houses [the Doom Emacs community discussions board][discuss],

## Discussion Categories

When creating a new post, try your best to select the best category to post in.
This ensures others quickly find answers to their questions as well as the
questions they may be able to answer. Plus some categories have templates that
prompt you for important information we need to diagnose your issues, without
which your post may be deleted *or* responses to your issue could be
significantly delayed.

- :mega: **Announcements** — where we post releases, important events, breaking
  changes, and status updates (which get mirrored to our socials).
- :thought_balloon: **General** — for discussions that don't fit in any other
  category. Say hi, share your experiences, meet fellow Doom users — just don't
  use this space to ask for help!
- :bulb: **Ideas** — for RFCs and feature requests, or discussing new modules,
  documentation, or other content before any actual work is done. Once an idea
  is approved, it is moved to that particular project's sub-category.
- :sos: **Issues** — a staging ground for potential bug reports. Not sure if
  your issue is Doom's responsibility to fix? Not sure which repository your
  issue should be posted to? Post here instead.
- :question: **Questions** — ask the community for help using, configuring or
  extending Doom Emacs. Or ask about the project's design, author, or future.
  Just don't use this space for resolving errors or bugs!
- **Projects** — these sub-categories exist for contributors and maintainers to
  discuss active development efforts, track approved RFCs, and deliver
  occasional updates about them. Use the other categories if you want to propose
  new ideas, ask user support questions, or bug reports (unless they are
  regressions from recent development efforts discussed there):
  - :busts_in_silhouette: Community
  - :hammer_and_wrench: Core
  - :heavy_plus_sign: Modules
  - :link: Websites


# Frequently asked questions

## I don't like Discord/Github, can we use `$PLATFORM`?

There are no plans to adopt any new platforms. It's enough effort managing what
we have.

## I have an issue to report, where do I report it?

If you have ruled out personal configuration and upstream bugs (from Emacs or
packages), are able to reproduce the issue on a stable version of Emacs, and can
identify which repository it belongs in, then report your issue to it's Github
issue tracker.

If you're uncertain about any part of your issue, then post it to [the Issues
category of our Discussion board][discuss] *or* discuss it with us [on our
Discord server][discord] (in the `#doom-help` channel).
  
Don't forget to include your `M-x doom/info` and any steps to reproduce the
issue!

## Should we post to the Discussion board or Discord server?

That's personal preference. Choose the option you're more comfortable with.

Discord tends to be more relaxed. Github Discussions are more visible (and
google-able). 

> [!WARNING]
> Choose one! Please don't post to both unless you haven't gotten a response in
> weeks!

## I have a question, comment, or complaint about the community or sponsorships...

**If your matter is sensitive** (e.g. concerns personal data, ban appeals,
issues with our moderators, or other private matters), email the project's
maintainer at support@doomemacs.org.

**Otherwise,** drop us a line on [our Github Discussion board][discuss] or [our
Discord server][discord].
