      Please try to include as much information as possible. Such as [backtraces for any errors](https://doomemacs.org/d/how2backtrace), any recent errors/warnings in the \*Messages\* buffer (`C-h e` to open it), or attempts to answer your question yourself and their result. Screenshots and screencasts help too!

      **Please take the time to properly format code and text dumps with [code fences](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks), or use a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com) (or similar) service.**

      Post the output of `M-x doom/info` or `$EMACSDIR/bin/doom info` to pastebin (or a similar service) and paste the link to it below. **Please do not paste the info dump directly into this text box! It pollutes our search engine results and makes it harder for everyone to find things!**

      If for some reason you can't supply this, write "n/a" below and describe your OS, Emacs version, and Doom config above.
